Important Details
-----------------
1) In addition to share and offline movie saving functionality, I also added 'Genre' of movies as part of detail view. I felt that this is one of the most important thing about movie we all look into.

2) One need to add her API key to successfuly run this app, other wise app will begin but wont be able to fetch data and will keep on asking for "connect to internet".

3) Used many github libraries. Added many animations, explore repository to find out !!!
